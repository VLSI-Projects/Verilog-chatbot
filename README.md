# Verilog-chatbot
A Streamlit-based application designed to help users generate Verilog testbenches with the power of the Qwen 2.5 Language Model (LLM). This project aims to streamline the process of creating Verilog testbenches by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and AI, offering users a user-friendly interface to generate high-quality testbenches from simple descriptions.

Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Generate Verilog testbenches by simply describing the behavior of the module you want to test in natural language.
AI-powered Assistance: Uses the Qwen 2.5 LLM to interpret the descriptions and generate Verilog code.
Streamlit Interface: A simple, interactive web interface powered by Streamlit for easy use.
Real-time Results: Get instant Verilog testbench code based on the description provided.
